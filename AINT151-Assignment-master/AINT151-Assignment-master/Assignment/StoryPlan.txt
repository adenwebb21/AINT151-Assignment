Basic stats can work
	Charisma

These statistics can be altered at the start of the game

These will be used for comparing against random rolls

Your character will be able to die, but not through a health system.
The death will occur at the end of a string of "wrong" choices

"Dice rolls" will not be too liberal as it can be frustrating to be subjected to an outcome
due to chance
